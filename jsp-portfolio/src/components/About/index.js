    <p>
               üèÜ My name is Jacob Pickron, I am the oldest of three. I was born in Houston
                and raised in San Antonio, Texas. I currently live in beautiful Breckenridge,
                Colorado. My passion outside of coding is football or "soccer" and cheering for 
                the greatest club in the world, Manchetser United. I also enjoy skiing, camping,
                and everything that comes with the outdoor lifestyle. I've really found a passion for coding
                and it has allowed my creative side to shine. I hope you can see that in my projects.
